                farms is home to thousands of cattle. The cattle are  managed
                using an old system written in an ancient computer
                language. Everyday Al-Safi employees had to be on-site, manually
                collecting cattle data. This is very tedious and very slow given
                that by the time data is collected, processed by the system,
                and then reported; the market valuation of these livestock would
                have already changed.

                When Al-Safi wanted to introduce RFID (Radio Frequencey
                Identification) technology to speed up livestock data collection
                process, they were faced with the issue of their old system not
                being able to adapt to their new technology and requirements.
                With the help of Al-Safi's financial department, I have built an
                entire system from scratch that sits in-between the old system
                and the end-user. Reports that are generated by they old system
                would be fed into my system and then my system would generate
                financial reports that follow new business rules and
                requirements.
